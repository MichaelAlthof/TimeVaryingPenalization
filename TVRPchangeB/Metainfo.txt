Description : 'Performs the Lasso regression with two distinct algorithms. The first one 
uses moving window method and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) or the generalized 
cross-validation (GCV) to calibrate the penalty parameter (lambda), and the second is 
called the real-time adaptive penalization (RAP). The simulated data contains a break 
point after which the parameter
beta changes. The code plots the time series of the average lambda in the Lasso regression. 
The average values are taken over the specified number of simulations.'

Keywords : 'Lasso, shrinkage, L1-norm penalty, change point, bic, gcv, 
adaptive penalization, regression, simulation, plot, moving window, time-series, beta, 
linear model'
