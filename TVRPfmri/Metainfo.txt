Description : 'Performs the Lasso regression with two distinct algorithms. The first one 
uses moving window method and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) or the generalized 
cross-validation (GCV) to calibrate the penalty parameter (lambda), and the second is 
called the real-time adaptive penalization (RAP). The input data are fMRI data collected 
as part of the Human Connectome Project. The dataset consists of measurements taken during 
an Emotion task. In the fitting procedure, each of the selected brain regions is taken as
a dependent variable and is regressed by means of the Lasso regression on the remaining 
ones. The code plots the time series of the average penalization parameter, lambda.'
